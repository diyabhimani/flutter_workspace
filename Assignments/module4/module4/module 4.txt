1. Explain how the Navigator widget works in Flutter.
ANS:
The Navigator widget is used to manage screen navigation in a Flutter app.
It works like a stack (LIFO – Last In First Out).
When you open a new screen → it is pushed onto the stack.
When you go back → the screen is popped from the stack.
Common Methods:
Navigator.push() → Open new screen
Navigator.pop() → Go back to previous screen
Navigator helps move between different pages of an app.

2. Describe the concept of named routes and their advantages over direct route navigation.
ANS:
Named routes allow navigation using route names (strings) instead of directly calling a screen.
Example: Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/home');

Advantages:
Code becomes cleaner and organized
Easy to manage multiple screens
Centralized route management in MaterialApp
Better for large applications
Named routes are more structured compared to direct navigation.

3. Explain how data can be passed between screens using route arguments.
ANS:
Data can be passed when navigating to another screen.

Method 1: Using Constructor
Pass data directly while calling Navigator.push().

Method 2: Using Route Arguments
With named routes, you can pass arguments:
Navigator.pushNamed(
  context,
  '/second',
  arguments: "Hello",
);

In the next screen, retrieve using:
ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments;

This allows sending text, numbers, or objects between screens.
