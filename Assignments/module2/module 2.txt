1. Explain the fundamental data types in Dart (int, double, String, List, Map, etc.) and their uses.
ANS:
Dart is the programming language used in Flutter for mobile app development. 
It provides several fundamental data types:
int: Used to store whole numbers such as 10, 25, -3.
double: Used to store decimal numbers such as 10.5, 3.14.
String: Used to store text or characters like names and messages.
bool: Stores only two values: true or false.
List: Used to store multiple values in a single variable in ordered form.
Map: Stores data in key–value pairs, useful for structured data.

2. Describe control structures in Dart with examples of if, else, for, while, and switch.
ANS:
Control structures are used to control the flow of execution in a program.
if statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
else statement: Executes when the if condition is false.
for loop: Repeats a block of code for a fixed number of times.
while loop: Repeats a block of code as long as the condition is true.
switch statement: Used to select one block of code from multiple options based on a value.

3. Explain object-oriented programming concepts in Dart, such as classes, inheritance,
polymorphism, and interfaces.
ANS:
Dart follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
Class: A blueprint used to create objects. It defines properties and methods.
Object: An instance of a class.
Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class using the extends keyword.
Polymorphism: Allows methods to have different implementations in different classes.
Interface: In Dart, every class can act as an interface using the implements keyword.

4. Describe asynchronous programming in Dart, including Future, async, await, and Stream.
ANS:
Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run without blocking the main program execution. It is useful for tasks like API calls and database operations.
Future: Represents a value that will be available in the future.
async: Used to define an asynchronous function.
await: Pauses execution until a Future is completed.
Stream: Used to handle multiple asynchronous values over time.
