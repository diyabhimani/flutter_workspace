1. Explain the difference between Stateless and Stateful widgets with examples.
ANS:
Flutter is developed by Google and uses widgets to build UI.

Stateless Widget:
Does not change after it is built.
Used for static UI (text, icons, images).
Example: Displaying a fixed welcome message.
Once created, it cannot update automatically.

Stateful Widget:
Can change dynamically during runtime.
Used when UI updates (button click, counter, form input).
Example: Counter app where number increases on button press.
It uses setState() to update the UI.

2. Describe the widget lifecycle and how state is managed in Stateful widgets.
ANS:
In Stateful Widget, lifecycle methods control how the widget behaves.
Important Lifecycle Methods:
createState() – Creates state object.
initState() – Called once when widget is created.
build() – Builds UI (can run many times).
setState() – Updates state and rebuilds UI.
dispose() – Called when widget is removed.

State Management:
State is stored inside the State class.
When setState() is called, Flutter rebuilds the widget to reflect changes.

3. List and describe five common Flutter layout widgets (e.g., Container, Column, Row).
ANS:
Flutter uses a widget tree structure.
1. Container:Used to add padding, margin, color, width, height.
2. Column:Arranges widgets vertically (top to bottom).
3. Row:Arranges widgets horizontally (left to right).
4. Stack:Places widgets on top of each other.
5. Expanded:Used inside Row/Column to take available space.
